    <p>The truth here is that we are a group of humans who love the classic American sandwich: the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. We went all met in a group onboarding at a tech company, and the age old
      "ice-breaker" time brought a rousing baring of souls when everyone was asked to describe their ideal PB&J. WHO KNEW so many people liked a different version? We were
      intrigued and excited to try out different options of the adult candy bar that is disguised as a sandwich. Coconut? Honey? Nutella? Grilled?!
      God Bless America and keep on spreadin' pals!</p>

    <h4>We use Justin's Nut Butters - here's some information about their company values, in their own words, and why we love their spreads!</h4>
    <h3>Passion</h3>
    <p>
        Growing up in a small mountain town in Pennsylvania, Justin’s family owned and operated a small natural foods store where he acquired an early awareness, education and appreciation for natural foods. Starting with frustration for lack of taste and variety in his vegetarian diet, Justin’s entrepreneurial drive and spirit of irreverence was discovered. Justin’s passion still lives on in the business decisions we make every day.</p>
    <h3>Consciousness</h3>
    <p>
        Justin’s values not only sustainable practices, but also integrity and transparency at every step of the way. By sourcing the highest-quality, local ingredients, simplifying the supply chain, and initiating environmentally friendly office practices, we strive to mitigate our environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to taking care of the earth, Justin’s emphasizes taking care of the community. We pay-it-forward through our hunger relief efforts with Conscious Alliance and the entrepreneurial global poverty relief efforts with Whole Planet Foundation.
    </p>
    <h3>Product</h3>
    <p>
        Since the very first batch of nuts entered Justin Gold’s food processor in his home kitchen in 2004, Justin’s innovations have transformed the conventional world of nut butters and confections by using a one-of-a-kind grinding process that merges high-quality, naturally delicious ingredients with amazing taste, texture and nutrition. This process took Justin two years to perfect, and the proof is in every bite.
        <br>
        Our products are made with common sense and the highest quality. And selectively choosing fine, all-natural ingredients will make them taste better. We think you’ll agree.
